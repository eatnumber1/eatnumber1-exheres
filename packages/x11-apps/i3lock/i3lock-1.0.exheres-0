SUMMARY="A slightly improved version of slock"
DESCRIPTION="
    i3lock improves slock by making it fork() and therefore combinable with
    commands to suspend your computer. Additionally, instead of turning off your
    screen via DPMS and/or displaying a black screen, i3lock displays a white
    screen so you can see if your computer failed to resume from suspend or if
    your screen is just locked. Also, when entering a wrong password, i3lock
    does not call XBell(). This is important because i3lock/slock think youâ€™ve
    entered a password when resuming from suspend, at least sometimes.

    Furthermore, i3lock supports PAM since version 1.0 (that is, LDAP users can
    use i3lock now, too).
